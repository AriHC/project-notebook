# Design notebook for week ending November 9, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

## Post-critique summary

By spending more time on the design, I might be able to speed up implementation. At the very least, it should ensure I don't head deep into an implementation only to decide I don't like the way it looks. Also, checkers is probably a better goal than chess as it still only uses one piece type. I need to think about visuals as well.

## Post-critique reflection

I like the idea of checkers instead of chess. Originally I was thinking it might be harder because I don't understand it quite as well, plus it's less ambitious, but I probably need that. It technically has two pieces, because of kings, but I could make kingless checkers (much more likely to stalemate, so I could make sure whatever logic I have for that that works for tic-tac-toe still works). My other reservation was checkers has forced moves. I could begin without that though, and then see how I might implement it. This feedback is a great idea to really help push me back in the direction of limited scope.

As it currently stands, I have this whole week set aside for design. Hopefully that should be enough, but we'll see. I hadn't thought of my language as particularly engineering heavy, but I suppose it might be. I will take this into consideration in my design, and after I have my ideal syntax down, spend some time thinking about the semantic interpretation, and how I can simplify it to make the coding easier.
